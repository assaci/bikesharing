# bikesharing
Create  worksheets, dashboards, and stories from New York City bike-sharing data. 

# Overview 
The purpose of this project is to analyze if the bicycle-sharing business is profitable and worth investing in. We will use New York Citi Bike data to provide a better insight into our analysis. 

We will use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, weâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

# Results

- Total number of trip  is 2,340,517
- Most commons trip duration is 5 minutes with 146752 users checking out at 5 minutes or less.
- Most males checkout after 5 minutes. Most commons trip duration for females is 11 minutes and for unknown is 6 minutes.
- The number of weekday rides peak in rush hour times between 7 am and 9 am and 4 pm and 7 pm. The busiest days are Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays from 8 am to 9 am in the mornings and 5 pm to 6 pm in the evenings. 
- Largest users of the bikes on weekdays are males. 
- User Trips by gender by Weekday. Most subscribers are males and the busiest weekday for rides are Thursdays and Fridays.
